    <h1 class="title">Battery project</h1>

    <p class="open">
      As you may or may not have noticed, our 'Hamster Power' project had some flaws. One of the most obvious flaws it had was that it 
      relied on a hamster to generate power. What if you wanted to boil the kettle but your hamster didn't want to run on its wheel? For 
      that problem I present 'Hamster Powered Battery' as a workable alterative to animal abuse via forced running (don't abuse animals), 
      using state of the art fluid dynamics and manipulating the power of the almighty GPE (Gravitational potential energy) to achieve a 
      definitely not efficient or self-sufficient, or even being able to be powered by the wheel, battery.
    </p>

    <h2 class="WTF" id="WTF_ID">What is it?</h2>

    <p class="WTF_P" id="WTF_ID">
      The way that it works is that it pumps water up to a higher reservoir to 'charge' and when energy is needed a valve opens causing
       water to flow into a water wheel and generate power. As previously stated this is not very efficient but on a large scale, like the 
       power grid, it is one of the only solutions. The project was intended to be more of a model than anything else to show the sort of 
       thing that is done in real life by the power grid.

    <h2 class = "WWW" id="WWW_ID">What went wrong?</h2>

    <p class ="WWW.P" id="WWW_ID">
      Many issues stopped us from completing this project, but there is a very big one that 100% killed and buried any hopes we had of making 
      it work. That problem is the lack of a glue gun due to it deciding to explode, evidence of which pictured below. Other problems that we had 
      to deal with were time constraints due to illness and other factors such as the water pressure being too low to turn the wheel and the first 
      tank not being 'compatible' with the pump.

    <h2 class="IRL" id = "IRL_ID">How is this concept used in real life?</h2>

    <p class = "IRL.P" id = "IRL_ID">
      As I've already said we actually do this in real life as part of the power grid, lower demand makes electricity cheaper at night and so we take advantage of
       that to pump enormous amounts of water up mountains to store it for when there is higher demand. The power grid knows that this is not the most efficient method, 
       but it does save money and help negate supply and demand. In the UK the biggest facility utilising this sort of system is Dinorwig Power Station in Wales, built into 
       what is sometimes called electric mountain.
