    <h1 class="title">Battery project</h1>

    <p class="open">
        As you may, or may not, have noticed our 'hamster power' project had some flaws. One of the most obvious flaws it had 
        was that it relied on a hamster to generate power. What if you wanted to boil the kettle but your hamster didn't want to
        run on his wheel? For that problem I present 'Hamster Powerd Battery' as a workable alterative to animal abuse (don't abuse 
        animals) Useing state of the art fluid dynamics and manipulating the power of the almighty GPE (Gravitatonal potential energy)
        to acheive a definatly not efficent or self-suffecient, or even being able to be powerd by the wheel, battery.
    </p>

    <h2 class="WTF" id="WTF_ID">What is it?</h2>

    <p class="WTF_P" id="WTF_ID">
      The way that it works is that it pumps water up to a higher resovior to 'charge' and when energy is needed a valve opens causing 
      water to flow into a water wheel and generate power. As previously stated this is not very efficent but on a large scale, like the 
      power grid, it is one of the only solutions. The project was inteded to be more of a model than anything else to show the sort of thing 
      that is done in real life by the power grid.

    <h2 class = "WWW" id="WWW_ID">What went wrong?</h2>

    <p class ="WWW.P" id="WWW_ID">
      Many issues stopped us from completeing this project, but there is one very big one that 100% killed any hopes we had of making it work. 
      That problem is the lack of a glue gun due to a slight "explosion" evidence of which pictured below. Other problems that we had to deal with 
      where time constraingts due to illnes and other factors, Water pressure being too small to turn the wheel and the first tank not being
      'compatible' with the pump.

    <h2 class="IRL" id = "IRL_ID">How is this concept used in real life?</h2>

    <p class = "IRL.P" id = "IRL_ID">
      As ive already said we acctually do this in real life as part of the power grid, lower demand makes eletrisity cheaper at night and so we 
      take advantage of that to pump tremendaous amounts of water up mountins to store it for when there is higher demand. The power grid does 
      know that this is not very efficent but it does save money and help negate supply and demand. In the uk the biggest facility utilising 
      this sort of system is Dinorwig Power Station in wales built into what is sometimes called eletric mountin.
